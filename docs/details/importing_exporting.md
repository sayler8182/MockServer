The `json` can be imported. There is no difference where You upload the file, the file's content will be
analysed and proper data will be imported. There is possibility to upload `zip` file which will be extracted in tmp
directory and the content `json` files will be imported like regular file. It is recommended to import initially `zip`
file not a `json`. See [Launching the MockServer Section](../docs.md).
